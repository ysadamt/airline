## Inspiration
We love traveling - but we hate boarding time. We decided to create Seatr to improve queue times during boarding and allow those who are veterans, elderly, or disabled to board first.

## What it does
Seatr reduces boarding time exponentially. Through our algo to sort user seat preference and create a queue for boarding, passengers wait a lot less in line!

## How we built it
We bootstrapped Seatr with T3, a bootstrapping agent that delivers TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next, and React all together. From there, we implemented an algorithm to sort user seat preferences and assign seating, and an algorithm that develops a queue based on passenger traits and passenger seat location for most efficiency.

## Challenges we ran into
We all had to learn TypeScript, Next, and React to develop the UI of our site. While many of us had exposure to HTML & CSS prior to this hack, we had little exposure to React. During this project, we had to do a LOT of Googling, and we mean A LOT to fully understand React and Next.js. We also implemented page routing, which was new to us to do in Next.

Some of us also did not have a lot of prior experience with Git and version control, so the initial stages of Googling and asking each other questions to be sure of the correct way to push our changes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're especially proud of our UI - we spent quite a large amount of time refining and perfecting our UI. Our DevPost project image is actually Seatr's landing page. :)

The seating algorithm that we developed was especially complicated, and had to account for a number of factors: seating preferences and random passengers who did not select a preferred seat. Our boarding algorithm that developed a queue on passenger traits was also complex to think up, but we're ultimately very proud of it in the end.

## What we learned
We learned most how to work as a team - during this project, we were all working on different files of the projects at different times, and constantly updating each other on impending pushes.

We learned how to use React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

In our hunt to deliver the perfect UI, we also learned quite a bit about design!

## What's next for Seatr: Solution to Air Boarding
Implementing a backend to get other passenger data, adding a check-in timer and boarding timer (for now, our algorithm works, but we had some difficulties establishing our backend). We're proud of Seatr, and there's so much more we could do with it!
